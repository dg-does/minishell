🧪 SUBJECT 1 — read() & write() Warm-up
mini_readline

Goal: Reimplement a super basic input loop without Readline.

Requirements:

Write a loop that:

prints >

uses read(0, buffer, BUF_SIZE)

stops when user enters “exit\n”

No get_next_line(), no readline.

Expected:

> hello
You typed: hello
> test
You typed: test
> exit
